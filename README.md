# Single_Cycle_MIPS_Processor
This repository contains the Complete implementation of the Single Cycle MIPS processor using Verilog. The processor supports R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions. The working and waveforms  has been shown with the software Scansion. The waveform focusses on the Register File and the Data Memory visualisation.
