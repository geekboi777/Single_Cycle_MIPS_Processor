# Single_Cycle_MIPS_Processor
This repository contains the Complete implementation of the Single Cycle MIPS processor using Verilog. The processor supports R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions. The working and waveforms  has been shown with the software Scansion. The waveform focusses on the Register File and the Data Memory visualisation. 

To run:

* Download the repository / code onto your pc  manually or using git clone 
* Use a simulator such as iverilog to compile the testbench / stimulus file
* Use Scansion / GTKWave or any alternate Waveform viewer to view the dump.vcd file generated to view the waveforms.
